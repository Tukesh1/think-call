I didnt passed the test because of the time complexity reason but you can ,if you optimise this code and decrease time complexity
# interval_map<K,V> Data Structure Implementation

The `interval_map<K,V>` data structure associates keys of type `K` with values of type `V`. It is designed to efficiently handle situations where intervals of consecutive keys are associated with the same value.

## Task Description

Your task is to implement the `assign` member function of this data structure. `interval_map<K,V>` is implemented on top of `std::map`. Each key-value pair `(k,v)` in `interval_map<K,V>::m_map` means that the value `v` is associated with all keys from `k` (including) to the next key (excluding) in `m_map`. The member `interval_map<K,V>::m_valBegin` holds the value that is associated with all keys less than the first key in `m_map`.

### Example

Let `M` be an instance of `interval_map<int,char>` where:
- `M.m_valBegin == 'A'`
- `M.m_map == { (1,'B'), (3,'A') }`

Then `M` represents the mapping:

# interval_map<K,V> Data Structure Implementation

The `interval_map<K,V>` data structure associates keys of type `K` with values of type `V`. It is designed to efficiently handle situations where intervals of consecutive keys are associated with the same value.

## Task Description

Your task is to implement the `assign` member function of this data structure. `interval_map<K,V>` is implemented on top of `std::map`. Each key-value pair `(k,v)` in `interval_map<K,V>::m_map` means that the value `v` is associated with all keys from `k` (including) to the next key (excluding) in `m_map`. The member `interval_map<K,V>::m_valBegin` holds the value that is associated with all keys less than the first key in `m_map`.

### Example

Let `M` be an instance of `interval_map<int,char>` where:
- `M.m_valBegin == 'A'`
- `M.m_map == { (1,'B'), (3,'A') }`

Then `M` represents the mapping:
<br>
-2 -> 'A'<br>
-1 -> 'A'<br>
0 -> 'A'<br>
1 -> 'B'<br>
2 -> 'B'<br>
3 -> 'A'<br>
4 -> 'A'<br>
5 -> 'A' <br>
...
<br>
The representation in the `std::map` must be canonical, meaning consecutive map entries must not contain the same value. For example, `(3,'A')`, `(5,'A')`, etc., are not allowed. Likewise, the first entry in `m_map` must not contain the same value as `m_valBegin`. Initially, the whole range of `K` is associated with a given initial value, passed to the constructor of the `interval_map<K,V>` data structure.

## Type Requirements

### Key type `K`
- Copyable and assignable
- Less-than comparable via `operator<`
- Does not implement any other operations, in particular no equality comparison or arithmetic operators.

### Value type `V`
- Copyable and assignable
- Equality-comparable via `operator==`
- Does not implement any other operations.
